# Angular Conduit Signal 

> ### Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://dev--taupe-pithivier-3c339a.netlify.app/#/)) was built using Angular version 16 with Signal API.
### [Demo](https://dev--taupe-pithivier-3c339a.netlify.app/#/)

This project was built to explore how **Angular 16 w/ Signal API** would look like in real project. I also tried using [@ngrx/component-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store) with **selectSignal()** as state management solution.


# Getting started
